## Problem Statement

Understanding how users interact with a product is crucial for retention and engagement. This project explores behavioral data to answer:

> "How can we segment users meaningfully to tailor product experiences and boost engagement?"

---

## Methods & Tools

- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Segmentation**: KMeans clustering
- **Visualization**: Cluster plots, distribution analyses
- **Communication**: Stakeholder report (PDF)

## Approach Overview

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed user metrics: frequency, recency, session time, feature usage.
   - Identified correlations and usage trends.

2. **User Segmentation**
   - Applied KMeans clustering to group users by behavioral patterns.
   - Chose optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

3. **Persona Development**
   - Created profiles for each segment (e.g., "Power Users", "Casual Visitors").
   - Visualized and described traits per persona.

4. **Recommendations**
   - Suggested engagement strategies tailored to each persona.
   - Aligned insights with product and marketing goals.

## Sample Personas

| Persona Name | Description | Recommendation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Power Users** | High activity, frequent logins | Offer loyalty rewards or beta features |
| **Casual Explorers** | Infrequent, light engagement | Use onboarding nudges and re-engagement campaigns |
| **New Users** | Recently joined, low interaction | Guide with tutorials or targeted tips |
